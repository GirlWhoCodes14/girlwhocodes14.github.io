## 🚀 Running the Site Locally

Whether you're brand new to Jekyll or already comfortable with it, here’s how to run this project locally.

### 🟦 For Beginners (Step‑by‑Step)

1. **Install Ruby**  
   Jekyll runs on Ruby.  
   - macOS: Ruby is preinstalled  
   - Windows: Install via RubyInstaller  
   - Linux: Use your package manager

2. **Install Jekyll and Bundler**
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   ```

3. **Clone your own repo**  
   Since this is a personal portfolio, please don’t clone mine.  
   But if you’re working on your own Jekyll site:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo>
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

6. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:4000
   ```

### 🟩 For Experienced Jekyll Users (Quick Start)

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

That’s it — Jekyll will build the site and serve it locally at `localhost:4000`.
