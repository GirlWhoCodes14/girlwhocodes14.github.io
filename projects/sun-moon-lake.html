					<h1 class="section-header">About</h1>
					<p>I constructed a 3D terrain in Unity of the 10KM area around Sun Moon Lake. Sun Moon Lake is in the foothills of Taiwan's Central Mountain Range. It is located in Yuchi, Nantou County, Taiwan.</p>
					<p>The scene includes some other surrounding bodies of water, such as T'ou-she Reservoir (頭社水庫), Mingtan Reservoir (明潭水庫) and Ming Hu.</p>

					<h1 class="section-header">How It Was Made</h1>
					<p>A height map was used to automatically generate the elevation of the area. The terrain tool box was imported into the project to get advanced terrain features, which I got the terrain layers from.</p>
					<p>The water, trees, character, and camera come from the Standard Asset package. The skybox came from 'AllSky Free' by rpgwhitelock. The grass came from 'Grass Flower Pack Free' by Alp. The 'VegetationSpawner' was used to disperse the trees, grass, and flowers. The boats came from 'Boats - PolyPack' by Alstra Infinite. Directional wind was added using Windzone.</p>
					<p>Structures from SketchUp's 3D Warehouse were used in the scene, such as a hotel, temple, pagoda, and village, to show where buildings like those are in the area.</p>
